# Welcome to {{hackweek}}!

We are excited to welcome you to the Disasters, Demography, Disparities and Decisions (D4) Hack Week.

This 5-day collaborative workshop hosted at the University of Washington tackles challenges associated with integrating social and weather datasets across spatial and temporal scales, in order to investigate demographic disparities and decision-making related to severe weather events like flooding, hurricanes, and wildfire.

This JupyterBook contains the information you need as a participant in the D4 Hack Week.

üìñ On this JupyterBook website you'll find [tutorials](tutorials/index). Some tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, designed to be run interactively, but also rendered on this website for convenience. Others are Youtube videos or text, which you can follow along.

üë©‚Äçüíª During the D4 Hack Week, teams work collaboratively on different projects related to integrating social and meteorological data. Read more about the projects on our [teams page](teams/index)
