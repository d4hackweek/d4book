# Hack Week Support

This workshop is supported by a partnership between the University of Washington (UW)’s [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/), the [National Science Foundation AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)](https://www.ai2es.org/), and the University of Washington [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/). 

Funding for the workshop derives from a grant from NOAA to AI2ES (Award NA23OAR40505031) and a center grant to CSDE from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development via the P2C HD042828 mechanism.

In his role as a *John C. Garcia Term Professor*, Dr. Shah recognizes the generous financial support made possible by Carole Garcia.

Support for the workshop organization is also provided through the Weyerhaeuser Endowed Professorship in Environmental Policy at the University of Washington Evans School of Public Policy & Governance.
