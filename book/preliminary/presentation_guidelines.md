# Presentation Guidelines

The purpose of Thursday’s presentation is for you to share with everyone else what you and your team have done, and show us a few results and/or steps toward results that address challenges like those highlighted below.

Each team will have 30 minutes to share, including time for questions. We encourage you to keep your presentation under 15 minutes.

Please keep your presentation fairly informal and short, to allow time for Q&A.

You are welcome to create a slide deck if you like, but there is no need for highly polished slides given the short duration of this event.

Don’t include anything you wouldn’t want to share publicly, as the presentations will be livestreamed on the CSDE Youtube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/@csdemainaccount9165/streams

Make sure everyone on your team gets a chance to speak about their D4 hack week experience.  We encourage your team to collectively address these questions, but please feel free to highlight what is most salient to you:
- What excited you most about this week?
- What challenges did you encounter as you integrated data for this D4 Hack Week, and how are you addressing them? 
- What insights from your work might facilitate how decision makers address flood events or the tools they use to make their decisions?  
- Of what you’ve learned this week, what are some potential outcomes or real world impacts?  
- What do you think are the most promising prospects for the work you tackled as part of this week? 
- What do you need to keep this work going?

*Reminder*:  The primary goal of this workshop is to help NOAA realize the full potential of dynamic and integrative data analysis to provide robust societal insights from flood events (and by extension, from other hazard events) by addressing methodological questions, such as:
- How granular (spatially, temporally) do the data have to be to understand social and ecological vulnerabilities in a way that is meaningful for policy design? 
- How can we know that the environmental and demographic/social phenomena are related to each other, especially when we may lack certain data products that represent fundamental, mediating socio-economic relationships (e.g. how land parcels are owned, as well as transacted and built upon), or even the quality of such products (e.g., spatial data)? 
- What are the most promising strategies for accessing, integrating, and making openly available integrated environmental, demographic, and related social data (and the code that links those data) so that privacy/confidentiality/intellectual property rights or other ethical guidelines are upheld?
