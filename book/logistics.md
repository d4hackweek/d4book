## Travel

-   Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.
-   The [Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/stations/link-light-rail-stations) is an easy, great way to get to the UW campus from the airport. It picks you up at the airport, comes about every 10-15 minutes, and drops you off right on the UW campus.

-   From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is \$3.00 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the northbound train toward Northgate and get off at one of the following stations:
    - University of Washington station; a 10-minute walk from the eScience Institute (on the 6th floor of the Physics/Astronomy Tower)
    - U District station; a 10-minute walk from the hotel.
-   Taxis and Uber/Lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for Uber/Lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pickup.
-   Your trips to and from the airport will be reimbursed, please email Maddie Farris at [csde-prgm-coord\@uw.edu](mailto:csde_prgm_coord@uw.edu) with the receipts 
-   Locations during the event are walking distance and will not need transportation if you are able to walk. If you have accessibility/mobility needs and would like to arrange transportation between spaces, please reach out to Maddie at [csde-prgm-coord\@uw.edu](mailto:csde_prgm_coord@uw.edu).

## Lodging

-   The [University Inn](https://www.staypineapple.com/university-inn-seattle-wa) is located at 4140 Roosevelt Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105.
-   You will be able to check-in at 4pm.
-   You have been listed in a hotel block titled “2024 D4 Hack Week” or have had an individual reservation created by us, just let the hotel know your name.
-   It has been noted if your Room & Tax will be paid through UW CSDE or if you are self-funded. Either way, a card will be collected at check-in to cover other incidentals that do not fall under Room & Tax.
-   Card collection at check-in can cause some confusion, but do not worry. If you do end up being charged for Room & Tax, we will be able to fix it with the hotel.
-   If you have any questions or concerns after check-out, please email [csde-prgm-coord\@uw.edu](mailto:csde-prgm-coord@uw.edu){.email}.

## Meals

-   Each meal will either be catered by the event or purchased on your own for reimbursement later (known as meal per diem). Meal Per Diem will be offered for meals that are not being catered through the event or provided by the hotel (i.e. continental breakfast).
-   For catered meals, we will accommodate dietary restrictions that are provided to us in advance of the hack week.
-   If a meal is provided but you choose to not eat what is provided, you will not be able to receive meal per diem for that meal.
-   Meal per diem will be received after the week is done as per [GSA per diem policy](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates) and [UW Travel Policy](https://finance.uw.edu/travel/)
-   Meal Per Diem in Seattle, Washington is: \$19/Breakfast, \$22/Lunch, \$38/Dinner
